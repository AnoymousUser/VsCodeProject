# Hashir Farooq's blog?

So this is my basic blog about my coding, writing and other stuff
Here is a plan on how I want to design my website
===

## Step 1: Blob cursor
My background should be very dark blue/black and have a blob cursor like hyperplexed but I should try to keep it very simple and watch his video so that I know the JS required to do so (I suck at JS).

## Step 2: Box-shaped divs
The box shaped divs are the containers leading to the indivitual website/blog. It should have two parts: A top part that is an image and a bottom with title and a subtext (It should be rounded on the corners) for extra cool.
